</p>

To use my Neovim configuration, please visit [Johanx22x/nvim](https://github.com/Johanx22x/nvim) 
and follow the installation instructions there. Once you have installed Neovim and cloned my dotfiles, 
you can copy the `nvim/` directory into your own `~/.config/` directory.

Note that these Neovim configuration files were customized and created by me and may require additional 
plugins to be installed for full functionality. Please refer to the installation instructions in the `README.md` 
file included with the `nvim/` directory for more information.
