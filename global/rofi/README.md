# Rofi config

To use my Rofi configuration, please visit [adi1090x/rofi](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi) and 
follow the installation instructions there. Once you have installed Rofi and cloned my dotfiles, 
you can copy the Rofi configuration files from `rofi/` into your own `~/.config/rofi/` directory.

Note that these Rofi configuration files were originally created by adi1090x and I have simply 
customized them to my own preferences. Any issues or bugs related to the Rofi configuration should 
be reported to adi1090x's repository.

Note: keep in mind that if you use my Sway config you must add certain things to your PATH, I invite 
you to review [global/sway](https://github.com/Johanx22x/dotfiles/tree/master/global/sway).
